        It's recently <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">come to people's attention</a> that long passphrases of multiple words
        are better than short passwords that are hard to remember. As a result, there are passphrase generators that string
        together a number of words.

        Reusing passwords is very risky. Generate fresh ones for each need and store a list in an encrypted file. (Static or reusable
        passwords are obsolete. If you have a choice of authentication methods, look for a stronger method than passwords.)
